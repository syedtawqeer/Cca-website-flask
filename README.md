🌐 Web Deployment Overview
To demonstrate the practical application of the SPAD value prediction model, a simple web application was developed and deployed using a basic Flask framework for the backend, combined with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface.

⚙️ Backend (Flask)
Developed a lightweight Flask application to serve the trained deep learning model.

Handled image uploads, preprocessing, and prediction through Flask routes.

Integrated the model inference pipeline to process user-submitted Capsicum leaf images and return predicted SPAD values in real time.

🎨 Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
Created a user-friendly web interface for uploading leaf images and viewing results.

Used HTML for structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity.

Displayed prediction results dynamically with a clean and responsive UI.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python (Flask)

TensorFlow / Keras

HTML / CSS / JavaScript

Bootstrap (optional, if used)



🚀 Purpose
Make the model accessible to non-technical users via a simple web interface.

Demonstrate real-world usability of AI models in agriculture with a focus on plant health monitoring.
